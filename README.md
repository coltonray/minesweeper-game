# minesweeper-game

This is Minesweeper for the Tritech Technical Excercise. It was built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. The program was built over the course of a day, instructed by the guidelines, there were not excessive hours spent on the project.

Attention was given to reaching a minimal viable product. Once that was reached, styling was prioritized in the final stretch. Small animations, color choices, and fonts. I used Visual Studio Code and the Live Server Extension found within VSC.

If you would like to view the work in the browser, open the code in Visual Studio Code, obtain the Live Server exstension and run as instructed.

Live Server's ID: ritwickdey.LiveServer
